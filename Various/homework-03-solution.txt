> What is the "Silly Window Syndrome" and why is it bad? See RFC-813.

Silly Window Syndrome occurs when the receiver sends an acknowledgement that contains a small
window size and the sender responds by right away sending a correspondingly small segment. This
can happen if the receiver process is consuming data in small chunks with a nearly full buffer
or if the sending process believes that nearly a full window size is in transit. In either case
only small segments get sent despite the large buffers that might be present on either end of
the connection, and network throughput is greatly impaired.

Old Method
==========

R <- A*R + (1 - A)*M
  R: Current estimate of round trip time.
  M: Last measured time.
  A: Weighting factor (0.9)

R_old   M       R_new
---------------------
10ms    10ms    10ms
10ms    12ms    10.2ms
10.2ms   9ms    10.1ms
10.1ms  21ms    11.2ms
11.2ms  10ms    11.1ms

Thus the final estimate of round-time time is 11.1ms. Note that this computation used the
initial measurement as the initial estimate.

The timeout interval is 2*R. At the end of the sequence above this comes to 22.2ms.

New Method
==========

E <- M - R
R <- R + g*E          (with g = 1/8)
D <- D + h*(|E| - D)  (with h = 1/4)

R_old   D_old   M       E       R_new   D_new
---------------------------------------------
10ms    0ms     10ms    0ms     10ms    0ms
10ms    0ms     12ms    2ms     10.2ms  0.5ms
10.2ms  0.5ms    9ms    -1.2ms  10ms    0.7ms
10ms    0.7ms   21ms    11ms    11.4ms  3.3ms
11.4ms  3.3ms   10ms    -1.4ms  11.2ms  2.8ms

Thus the final estimate of round-trip time is 11.2ms.

The timeout interval is R + 4*D = 22.4ms.
