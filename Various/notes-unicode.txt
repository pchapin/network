Unicode Notes
=============

UTF-32
------

Each code point is represented by itself in 32 bits. This works because 32 bits is enough to
handle the entire Unicode code space (from U+0000 to U+10FFFF). Notice that every Unicode
character has an official name.

00 00 00 58  "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X" U+0058
00 00 03 B1  "GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA" U+03B1

Fixed length encoding (every character encodes using the same number of bytes)
  - The length of a string in bytes is simply related to the length in characters.
  - Random access of characters is easy (constant time).

UTF-16
------

Each code point is represented by a 16 bit code unit.

All BMP characters are represented by themselves
Technically, UTF-16 is a variable lenght encoding
  - The length of a string in bytes is not directly related to the length in character.
  - Random access of characters isn't easy (linear time).

UTF-16
UTF-16BE ("big endian")
UTF-16LE ("little endian")

UTF-8
-----

The ASCII characters are represented as themselves. An ASCII file is already a UTF-8 encoded
Unicode file.

Suppose:

  10 marks (as combining characters)
