CIS-3152, Network Programming, Final Exam
==========================================

This is a take home final exam. You can use as much time as you want to answer the following
questions. You may consult class notes, your text book, or other on-line sources. If you use
materials other than those presented in class or in the text book, please note your source in
your answer. You are also allowed (even encouraged) to make use of the C or Java compilers. You
may NOT consult with other students, or post questions on public forums or mailing lists. If you
need clarification (or would like a hint) about any question please email me. Return this exam
via email or Moodle by 11:55pm, Friday, May 8, 2015. The exam is worth 50 points.

Good luck and enjoy!

0. The call to connect in a typical sockets based TCP program uses a second argument that looks
   like '(struct sockaddr *) &server_address' where server_address is a struct sockaddr_in. Why
   is the type conversion necessary? In other words: why wasn't connect declared to take a
   struct sockaddr_in * in the first place?


1. Under what conditions would it be appropriate to use an iterative TCP server instead of a
   concurrent one?


2. Under what conditions would it be appropriate to use UDP rather thatn TCP when implementing a
   service?


3. Outline the steps necessary to convert a C program using IPv4 to one using IPv6. Assume you
   don't need to worry about supporting both protocols.


4. What is the "byte order mark" and what is its purpose?


5. What are the bytes (in hex) of the UTF-8 string "=Î±="? Note that the character between the
   equals sign is the lower case greek letter alpha. You can look up its Unicode code point
   (http://www.unicode.org).


6. Classic SMTP is said to be a "stop and wait" protocol. What does this mean and what is bad
   about it?


7. What's the difference between a MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding of "8bit" and a Content-
   Transfer-Encoding of "binary?" Justify your answer with an appropriate reference to RFC-2045.


8. RPC systems are supposed to make programming over the network easier by hiding the network.
   However, this hiding is always imperfect. Why?


9. Suppose you wanted to write an RPC server that managed a simple database. Your server is to
   provide a object with a method named update_account that takes a name as an arbitrary string,
   an account ID number as a 32 bit integer, and a new balance value as two 32 bit integers (one
   for dollars and the other for cents). Show a slice specification that captures these
   requirements.
