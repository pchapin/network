SMTP pipelining allows multiple commands to be sent by the client without
having to wait for the server to respond to each command. This can
streamline the transfer of information by eliminating (or at least
reducing) the effect of the network transit time on the overall average
data transfer rate.

Note that since TCP is a windowed protocol, bulk data will be transferred
efficiently regardless. Thus SMTP pipelining is only really useful in the
case when the email messages are small (insignificant amount of bulk data)
and the number of messages sent to a particular destination is large (large
amount of normally stop-and-wait exchanges). SMTP pipelining will not
improve the speed at which a single large message is sent.

> What does the SMTP command "VRFY" do?

Section 4.1.1.6 of RFC-5321 says:

   This command asks the receiver to confirm that the argument identifies a
   user or mailbox. If it is a user name, information is returned as
   specified in section 3.5.

It can be used to check the validity of an email address without, for
example, trying to send a "probe" message to that address. Note that there
are security implications to this command. Sites may wish to disable it or
only allow authenticated users to access it.

Section 4.2.1 of RFC-5321 says:

   The format for multiline replies requires that every line, except the
   last, begin with the reply code, followed immediately by a hyphen, "-"
   (also known as minus), followed by text. The last line will begin with
   the reply code, followed immediately by <SP>, optionally some text, and
   <CRLF>. As noted above, servers SHOULD send the <SP> if subsequent text
   is not sent, but clients MUST be prepared for it to be omitted.
