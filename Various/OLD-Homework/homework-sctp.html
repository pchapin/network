    <h1>CIS-3152 Homework #3 (SCTP)</h1>

    <p><i>Due: Monday, March 10, 2014</i></p>
    
    <p>In this assignment you'll look at the SCTP protocol.</p>

    <p>Stevens talks about SCTP throughout the text. A quick overview is given in section 2.5.
    Chapter 9 covers many of the details. Information on how to use the <tt>sendmsg</tt> and
    <tt>recvmsg</tt> functions are in section 14.5. You can also refer to the man pages or other
    Internet resources.</p>

    <p>SCTP is a relatively new, alternative transport protocol with many advanced features. In
    principle it could replace TCP although it is not widely used (why not?). For this
    assignment write a demonstration daytime client and server that uses SCTP instead of TCP for
    communication. Start by copying the "stock" daytime client and server and modifying
    them.</p>

    <p>It is possible to make this work by making only a fairly small change to the
    initialization sequence of both programs. That will be sufficient for two thirds of the
    credit. However, for full credit you should replace the client's call to <tt>read</tt> with
    a call to the (more complicated but more flexible) <tt>recvmsg</tt> function. Similarly
    replace the server's call to <tt>write</tt> with <tt>sendmsg</tt>. Figuring out how to use
    these functions is the challenging part of this assignment! HINT: You do not need to send
    any control information nor specify any space for peer address information.</p>

    <p>Observe the communication between the programs using Wireshark and notice that it is
    <em>not</em> using TCP.</p>

    <p>This simple demonstration program does not delve into SCTP's enhancements at all.
    However, it is interesting to see how the sockets API can be used to access a variety of
    different protocols. You have seen three transport layer protocols: TCP, UDP, and now SCTP,
    as well as two network layer protocols: IPv4 and IPv6. What would be involved in using SCTP
    over IPv6?</p>
