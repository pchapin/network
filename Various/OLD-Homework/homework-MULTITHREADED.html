    <h1>CIS-3152 Homework #2 (Multi-threaded Servers)</h1>

    <p><i>Due: Friday, February 1, 2013</i></p>
    
    <p>This homework covers basic multi-threaded programming. You might find my <a
    href="../pthread/pthread-Tutorial.pdf">pthread tutorial</a> to be a useful resource. Read
    sections 2.4, 2.6, and 2.7 in the text.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>As the first step in creating a fully correct threaded version of the daytime
      server, make the following changes to the sample server provided on HackBox (don't forget
      to do an <tt>svn update</tt> command in the <tt>Samples</tt> folder first).</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Move the loop that accepts connections and creates threads for servicing clients
          into its own function.</li>

          <li>Move the signal handling loop, currently in a separate thread to the bottom of the
          <tt>main</tt> function.</li>

          <li>Just before the signal handling loop, create a thread that runs the function
          holding the accept loop (the function you made in the first step above).</li>

          <li>When the server is being shutdown use <tt>pthread_cancel</tt> to terminate the
          thread running the accept loop. You should also close the listening handle.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will need to use <tt>pthread_setcanceltype</tt> to change the accept loop's
        cancelability type to <tt>PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS</tt> just before it calls
        <tt>accept</tt> (otherwise attempts to cancel the thread while it is in <tt>accept</tt>
        will fail). Set the cancelability type back to <tt>PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED</tt> when
        <tt>accept</tt> returns.</p>

        <p>These changes set the stage for cleaningly processing any active connections when a
        shutdown is attempted. Although not part of this assignment, the overall steps would be
        to first cancel the "main" loop so that new clients are not accepted (which you are
        doing above) and then shut down any remaining active threads in a sensible manner (which
        you don't need to worry about now).</p></li>
    </ol>
