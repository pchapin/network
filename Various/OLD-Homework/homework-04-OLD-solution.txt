An IPv6 anycast address is assigned to multiple interfaces. The IPv6
routing infrastructure will deliver a packet with an anycast destination
address to the single "nearest" interface with that address. Here nearness
is measured according to the routing algorithms that are being used.

The use of anycast addresses is still experimental. However, one potential
use that comes to mind is automatic load balancing. Suppose a heavily used
service is implemented on several servers spread over the network. Suppose
also that every server is identical in that every server can, potentially,
service the requests of any client. To balance the load on the servers,
clients should distribute their requests at random. However, such an
approach can increase long distance network traffic and thus network
congestion. It also requires all clients to know about all servers---an
unrealistic expectation in general.

Another load balancing method might be to give the service an anycast
address. Every client then accesses the service using a single address that
represents any of the servers. The IPv6 routers choose the actual server
that is used.

Probably the service needs to be a UDP based service. It might be difficult
to maintain a TCP connection to a server using an anycast address. For
example some TCP segments on the connection could get routed to a different
server causing the other server to reply with RST segments. However, the
root DNS servers might be excellent candidates for this anycast method of
load balancing. The root DNS servers use UDP, experience heavy loading, and
are widely distributed. Currently DNS systems need to maintain a changing
list of root DNS server IP addresses. If they all used a single anycast
address instead the set of root DNS servers could change without there
being a need to update the root lists on all the other DNS servers in the
world. Furthermore the IPv6 routers could automatically direct root DNS
queries to the nearest root server.

One complication in using anycast addresses is that the routers must know
about the particular anycast addresses in use and the location of all the
servers participating in an anycast service. Currently routers are not this
"smart".

CIDR refers to the practice of splitting an address into a prefix
describing the network on which the host is located and a specific host
number on that network. Unlike the old class-based system the number of
bits used for a prefix is variable and changes depending on the context.
For example, high level routers might make routing decisions based on only
a few bits of prefix information, sending packets for a large number of
related addresses in the same general direction. In contrast routers on a
local network will use a large number of prefix bits to distinguish one
individual link from another. This approach implies that hosts with similar
addresses will be topologically "close" on the network.

IPv6 uses CIDR style addresses by design. In contrast CIDR was added to
IPv4 long after IPv4's initial deployment. As a result many pre-CIDR
addresses are still being used in the IPv4 world, unnecessarily clogging up
routing tables.

In section five (Packet Size Issues) of RFC-2460 we have:

   IPv6 requires that every link in the internet have an MTU of 1280 octets
   or greater. On any link that cannot convey a 1280-octet packet in one
   piece, link-specific fragmentation and reassembly must be provided at a
   layer below IPv6.

The larger minimum MTU size will not necessary prevent IPv6 from being used
on some links where IPv4 is currently being used. In cases where the larger
packets won't fit the link itself could provide some sort of fragmentation
as mentioned in the quote above.

6to4 tunneling requires the machine that is the tunnel endpoint to have a
global IPv4 address. However, machines that are behind NAT (Network Address
Translation) devices are normally using private ("non-routable") IPv4
addresses. These machines can't use 6to4 tunneling.

Teredo Tunneling puts IPv6 packets into UDP datagrams that are encapsulated
in IPv4 packets. NAT devices will pass UDP datagrams (using the port
mapping techniques that are normal for NAT), thus allowing machines behind
a NAT device to use IPv6 tunnels. Note that for a machine using Teredo
Tunneling to communicate with native IPv6 machines, it is necessary to use
a "Teredo relay." Such a machine is where the IPv6 packets are decapsulated
from the UDP datagrams and then routed on to their final destination.
