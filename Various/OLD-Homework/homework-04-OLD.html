  <h1>CIS-3152 Homework #4 (IPv6)</h1>

  <p><em>Due: Friday, March 12, 2010</em></p>

  <p>This homework covers IPv6. The text book discusses the basics of IPv6 in Appendix A. There
    are also many IPv6 related RFCs---too many to mention them all here. Here are a few
    highlights.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>RFC-2373: The format of IPv6 addresses.</li>
    <li>RFC-2460: The base specification for IPv6.</li>
    <li>RFC-2461: Neighbor discovery protocol.</li>
    <li>RFC-2462: Address autoconfiguration.</li>
    <li>RFC-2463: ICMPv6.</li>
    <li>RFC-2646: Using IPv6 on Ethernet.</li>
    <li>RFC-3056: 6to4 Tunneling.</li>
    <li>RFC-4193: Unique local addresses.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Feel free to look over some of these RFCs although you might find the discussion in the
    text to be shorter and more approachable.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>IPv6 defines the concept of an "anycast" address. What does this mean? Can you think
      of an interesting application of such addresses? What problems can you see with using
      them? HINT: Think about what anycast addresses imply for routers. See RFC-2373.</p></li>

    <li><p>What is Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) and how does it relate to IPv6?</p></li>

    <li><p>Every link that will carry IPv6 needs to support a certain minimum MTU (Maximum
      Transmission Unit) size. What is that size? Provide a reference. The minimum MTU for IPv6
      is larger than that for IPv4. Will this prevent IPv6 from being sent over some links
      currently in use? Explain.</p></li>

    <li><p>Look up "Teredo Tunneling" online and write a short description (one or two
      paragraphs) that describes what it is and why it is useful. Give a reference for any
      source that you use.</p></li>
