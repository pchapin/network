<h1>CIS-3152 Homework #5 (SMTP)</h1>

<p><i>Due: Friday, March 16, 2012</i></p>

<p>This homework covers the SMTP protocol. Read over RFC-5321 (SMTP). This RFC is relatively
  long so don't attempt to read every word (unless you've got a lot of extra time on your hands
  and want to become a mail guru). You should, however, at least skim over the document and get
  a sense of what is in it. Read a few interesting looking parts---particularly anything that
  looks familiar from class.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Classic SMTP is a stop and wait protocol. Stop and wait protocols are normally very
    inefficient on high latency networks. (Why?) RFC-2920 defines an SMTP extension called
    "pipelining" that clients and servers can use to enhance SMTP performance on such networks.
    However, pipelining will not significantly speed up every SMTP transaction. In what
    situations would SMTP pipelining be a real help? In what situations would it not make much
    difference?</p></li>

  <li><p>What does the SMTP command "VRFY" do? In which section(s) of RFC-5321 did you find this
    information?</p></li>

  <li><p>In some cases an SMTP server may reply to a client query with a multiline reply.
    Describe exactly the format these multiline replies must use. In which section(s) of
    RFC-5321 is this format specified?</p></li>

  <li><p>Show a client side SMTP state diagram similar to the one you used in lab for the server
    side.</p></li>
