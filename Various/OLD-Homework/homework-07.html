<h1>CIS-3152 Homework #7</h1>

<p>This worksheet covers Sun's RPC protocol. The two RPC RFCs are RFC-1831, "RPC: Remote
  Procedure Call Protocol Specification Version 2" and RFC-1832, "XDR: External Data
  Representation Standard".</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Suppose you wanted to write an RPC server that managed a simple database. Your server
    is to provide a procedure named <code>update_account</code> that takes a name as an
    arbitrary string, an account ID number as a 32 bit integer, and a new balance value as two
    32 bit integers (one for dollars and the other for cents). Show a full specification for
    this server (and its one and only procedure) in the RPC language discussed in class. In
    particular, show an appropriate .x file that would be acceptable
    to <code>rpcgen</code>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Show the XDR form of the data sent over the network by the client to the server when
    the name is "Chapin", account ID is 0x12345678, and new balance is $21.15. I'm only
    interested in the procedure parameters here---not the RPC call header. Be sure to indicate
    any counts and padding bytes appropriately.</p></li>

  <li><p>Abstract syntax notation number 1 (ASN.1), together with the BER encoding rules, plays
    a role similar to that played by XDR. One significant difference between XDR and ASN.1/BER
    is that in BER each value is preceeded by a field indicating the type of that value. Comment
    on the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches.</p></li>
