    <h1>CIS-3152 Homework #3 (Advanced TCP Protocol)</h1>

    <p><em>Due: Friday, February 12, 2010</em></p>

    <p>This homework covers the details of the TCP protocol. Details about the original TCP
      protocol are in RFC-793. RFC-1122 describes requirements on hosts that implement the
      TCP/IP protocol suite. TCP requirements are discussed in section 4. RFC-2581 contains a
      modern discussion of TCP's "slow start" algorithm.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>What is the "Silly Window Syndrome" and why is it bad? See RFC-813.</p></li>

      <li><p>What is "Nagle's Algorithm" and what problem is it trying to solve? See RFC-896.
        Look for the section titled "The small-packet problem." Note that in RFC-896, Nagle
        often uses the word "packet" when "segment" would have been more appropriate. Note also
        that RFC-896 was written in 1984 when the Internet was starting to evolve into a more
        general purpose network. Some of Nagle's discussion about why the original network
        didn't have as many problems is interesting but of historical significance
        only.</p></li>

      <li><p>What is the difference between the "slow start" and "congestion avoidance"
        algorithms? You can just give a qualitative description. See RFC-2581, section
        3.</p></li>

      <li><p>Suppose a sequence of segments are sent with the following round trip times: 10ms,
        12ms, 9ms, 21ms, 10ms. Using the two methods described in class, what would TCP's
        estimate of the round trip time be after the last segment? What time-out interval would
        it use at that point? Use the first measured round trip time for the initial value of
        the round trip estimate. Use zero for the initial estimate of the deviation.</p></li>
