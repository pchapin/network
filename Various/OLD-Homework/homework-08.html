<h1>CIS-3152 Homework #8</h1>

<p>This worksheet covers distributed applications using Ice. As a
reference use your class notes and  the Ice documentation (which can be
downloaded from <a href="http://www.zeroc.com">http://www.zeroc.com</a>).</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Suppose you wanted to implement a file server with an Ice interface.
    Using the slice interface definition language, write the specification
    for an interface <code>File</code> that allows read access to a file. The
    interface should include a <code>close</code> method as well. Also write
    the specification for an interface <code>FileServer</code> that has an
    <code>open</code> method returning a proxy to a <code>File</code>
    instance.<code></code></p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Show C++ class definitions for classes <code>File_impl</code> and
    <code>FileServer_impl</code> that you might create to implement the
    interfaces described in the first question. You do not need to implement
    the methods themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>On the Zeroc web site there are two documents comparing Ice with 
    CORBA and with SOAP (Web Services). Go to their site and pull down the
    "Ice" menu on the menu bar. Read those documents and write a short
    paragraph summarizing their main points.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Ice (and similar technologies) involve allocating objects on various
    nodes in the network and passing references (called "proxies" in Ice)
    over the network to other nodes. Cleaning up allocated objects can be
    done explicitly or alternatively by using a distributed garbage
    collection algorithm. However, distributed garbage collection is hard
    (Ice doesn't do it). Why is it hard?</p>
  </li>
