    <h1>CIS-3152 Exam #1</h1>

    <p><i>Due: Friday, April 11, 2014</i></p>

    <p>This exam covers all material up to and including email protocols.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The call to <tt>connect</tt> in a typical sockets based TCP program uses a second
      argument that looks like <tt>(struct sockaddr *) &amp;server_address</tt> where
      <tt>server_address</tt> is a <tt>struct sockaddr_in</tt>. Why is the type conversion
      necessary? In other words: why wasn't <tt>connect</tt> declared to take a <tt>struct
      sockaddr_in *</tt> in the first place?</p></li>

      <li><p>What is the advantage of using a concurrent TCP server? On the other hand, under
      what conditions would it be appropriate to use an iterative TCP server?</p></li>

      <li><p>Answer two of the three questions below.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>When a client program calls <tt>connect</tt>, what state or states in the TCP state
        diagram does the connection touch?</li>
        <li>What is the difference between "active close" and "passive close?"</li>
        <li>What sequence of states does the TCP connection touch when the side doing the
        passive close calls <tt>close</tt>? You can assume normal, error free behavior.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>

      <li><p>UDP is an unreliable protocol. However, some services are most appropriately
      implemented as UDP services rather than using the more reliable TCP (DNS and TFTP are like
      this). Give at least one <em>advantage</em> that UDP has over TCP in these cases. Under
      what conditions is the unreliability of UDP not an issue?</p></li>

      <li><p>A program that uses UDP will use the <tt>sendto</tt> and <tt>recvfrom</tt>
      functions instead of the <tt>send</tt>/<tt>recv</tt> or <tt>write</tt>/<tt>read</tt>
      functions that a TCP based program would use. The <tt>sendto</tt> and <tt>recvfrom</tt>
      functions both take a pointer to a sockaddr structure as a parameter. What is the purpose
      of this parameter and why do the UDP functions require it while the TCP functions do
      not?</p></li>

      <li><p>An earlier version of the Pegasus Mail program allowed you to compose mail
      off-line. When you were finished writing the mail and clicked on "Send" the message was
      put into a queue for delivery when Pegasus Mail was once again connected to the network.
      However, the Date field on the outgoing message was set to when it was actually
      transmitted across the network; sometimes several hours after it was queued for delivery.
      Is this behavior correct? Justify your answer with appropriate reference to
      RFC-5322.</p></li>

      <li><p>What's the difference between a MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding of "8bit" and a
      Content-Transfer-Encoding of "binary?" Justify your answer with appropriate reference to
      RFC-2045.</p></li>

      <li><p>What is the base64 encoding of the UTF-8 string "=α="? What is the quoted printable
      encoding of the same string? Note that the character between the equals sign is the lower
      case greek letter alpha. You'll need to look up its Unicode code point (<a
      href="http://www.unicode.org">http://www.unicode.org</a>) and then convert it to UTF-8
      form to know exactly what binary bytes are to be encoded.</p></li>

      <li><p>Skim over RFC-1896 on the text/enriched MIME type. Use a text editor to manually
      construct a short message that demonstrates some of the features of enriched text. Don't
      forget to include appropriate RFC-5322 and MIME related header fields on your message so
      that it is a valid message.</p></li>

      <li><p>It is possible to send HTML mail (Content-Type: text/html) such that links to
      embedded images in the message refer to message attachments. This allows a person to email
      a complex document, complete with images, as an entirely self-contained message. Describe
      how this works (give references to appropriate documentation).</p></li>
