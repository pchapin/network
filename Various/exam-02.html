    <h1>CIS-3152 Exam #2</h1>

    <p><i>Due: Thursday, May 8, 2014</i></p>

    <p>This exam covers all material related to XML and RPC. Each question is worth 10
    points.</p>

    <ol>

      <li><p>Consider the following fragment of an XML Schema that defines an element
      <tt>xyzzy</tt>. Show <strong>three</strong> example instances of an <tt>xyzzy</tt> element
      that conform to this schema.</p>

      <pre>&lt;element name="xyzzy"&gt;<br />  &lt;xs:complexType&gt;<br />    &lt;xs:sequence&gt;<br />      &lt;xs:element name="a" type="xs:string"/&gt;<br />      &lt;xs:choice minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="2"/&gt;<br />        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;<br />          &lt;xs:element name="b" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded" type="xs:string"/&gt;<br />          &lt;xs:element name="c" minOccurs="0" type="xs:date"/&gt;<br />        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;<br />        &lt;xs:element name="d" type="xs:string"/&gt;<br />      &lt;/xs:choice&gt;<br />    &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;<br />  &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;<br />&lt;/element&gt;</pre>
      </li>

      <li><p>Consider Recipe Markup Language (RML) as developed in class. Enhance the schema so
      that recipes can include a &lt;ratings&gt; element that contains information about the
      recipe's ratings. Ratings should be on a scale of 1 to 10 and should only allow integer
      values. Allow a recipe to be rated by multiple reviewers with each reviewer providing a
      single rating value. Your solution for this question should include the modified RML
      schema. You don't need to provide a specific instance document.</p></li>

      <li><p>Suppose you wanted to write an RPC server that managed a simple database. Your
      server is to provide a procedure named <code>update_account</code> that takes a name as an
      arbitrary string, an account ID number as a 32 bit integer, and a new balance value as two
      32 bit integers (one for dollars and the other for cents). Show a full specification for
      this server (and its one and only procedure) in the SUN RPC language discussed in class.
      In particular, show an appropriate .x file that would be acceptable to
      <tt>rpcgen</tt>.</p></li>

      <li><p>For the situation described in the previous question show the XDR form of the data
      sent over the network by the client to the server when the name is "Chapin", account ID is
      0x12345678, and new balance is $21.15. I'm only interested in the procedure parameters
      here---not the RPC call header. Be sure to indicate any counts and padding bytes
      appropriately.</p></li>

      <li><p>Repeat question #3 but instead create a slice specification that would be
      acceptable to <tt>slice2java</tt>.</p></li>
    </ol>
