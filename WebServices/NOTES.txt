To deploy a web service on Axis:

1. Start the Axis server and do:
   java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient 
     -lhttp://localhost:8081/axis/services/AdminService deploy.wsdd

2. In the same directory where the Axis engine runs:
   java org.apache.axis.utils.Admin client|server deploy.wsdd

This assumes you have created an appropriate wsdd file.
