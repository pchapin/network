# Network

This repository contains various network programming experiments. It is a mixup of code in
various languages that use various network programming techniques. I use this repository as a
test bed and self-educational platform. The quality of the code is highly variable, although I
hope there is a tendency for it to converge on better examples!

The MailFlux folder contains the Java version of the MailFlux system. The (main) C++ version
is in the [MailVision](https://github.com/pchapin/mailvision) project.
